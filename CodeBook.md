The data found here is the result of cleaning  data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphon.

The original data is described at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. Here is an excerpt:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age 
bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded 
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected
for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
